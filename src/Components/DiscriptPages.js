    In 2018, after Wade Wilson uses Cable's time-travel device to prevent the death of his girlfriend Vanessa Carlysle,[a] he travels from his universe, Earth-10005,[b] to Earth-616 / the "Sacred Timeline",[c] hoping to join the Avengers and give his life added meaning. He is rejected by Happy Hogan and returns to his own universe. Six years later, Wade has broken up with Vanessa and retired from being the masked mercenary Deadpool. He works as a used-car salesman with his friend Peter Wisdom.

During Wade's birthday party, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) captures him and brings him to Mr. Paradox, who explains that they are an organization outside of time that monitors the Sacred Timeline and wider multiverse.</p>
 <p> Paradox reveals that Wade's timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of its stabilizing "anchor being", Logan, while protecting his daughter Laura.[d] Paradox plans to use a device called a "Time Ripper" to speed up this process rather than spend thousands of years waiting for the timeline to die naturally. He offers to spare Wade by sending him to the Sacred Timeline where he is expected to play an important role in future events. Wade steals Paradox's TemPad and uses it to travel to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save their timeline. When this fails, Wade uses the TemPad to travel the multiverse in search of an alternate universe "variant" of Logan that can replace his own.

Wade returns to the TVA with a variant of Logan but is told by Paradox that an anchor being cannot be replaced, and that this variant is considered the worst Wolverine in the multiverse. When Wade deduces that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox sends Wade and Logan to the Void where all things are consumed by the creature Alioth. Logan agrees to work with Wade when he claims that the TVA can change his timeline. Wade and Logan are captured with Johnny Storm and taken to Cassandra Nova, the powerful and sadistic twin sister of X-Men leader Charles Xavier. Cassandra, who made a deal with the TVA to oversee the Void, kills Johnny and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by Alioth. The pair manage to escape.

Logan and Wade meet a variant of Deadpool called "Nicepool" who gives them a car and directs them towards a resistance group who have been fighting against Cassandra. On the way, Logan realizes that it may not be possible to fix his timeline and the pair fight until both are left unconscious. They are found by the resistance group, consisting of Laura, Elektra, Blade, and Gambit. Wade proposes an alliance to fight Cassandra, and Laura convinces Logan to join. The resistance members distract Cassandra's henchmen while Wade and Logan block her powers by placing Juggernaut's helmet on her head. Cassandra is betrayed by her follower Pyro on behalf of Paradox and almost dies until Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet. Cassandra heals herself and opens a portal to Earth-10005 where Wade and Logan learn that Paradox has completed the Time Ripper.
